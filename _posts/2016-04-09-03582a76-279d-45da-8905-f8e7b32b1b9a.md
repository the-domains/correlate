\# what we are about

"A \*\*good\*\* strategy provides a \*\*clear\*\* roadmap, consisting of a set of guiding principles or rules, that \*\*defines\*\* the actions people in the business should \*\*take\*\* (and not take) and the things they should \*\*prioritize\*\* (and not prioritize) to \*\*achieve desired goals.\*\*"

\*Michael Watkins, Leading Edge\*

"The goal of an enterprise architecture should not be to document \*\*every\*\* business process, every software system, and every database record that exists throughout the organization. It should be about \*\*adding\*\* business \*\*value\*\*."

\*Roger Sessions, Simple Architectures for Complex Enterprises\*

"\*\*Enterprise\*\* - readiness to embark on new ventures; boldness and energy

\*Collins english Dictionary\*

"\*IF\* the \*\*fundamentals\*\* are in place then a \*\*small change\*\* can create a \*\*massive result\*\*"

\*Roger Black\*

"The \*\*thicker\*\* the planning document, the more \*\*useless\*\* it will be"

\*Brent Davies 1999\*

"Powerpoint makes \*\*us\*\* look \*\*stupid\*\*"

\*Gen. James N. Mattis of the US Marine Corps\*

"Bank of America famously stated that their \*\*goal\*\* is not to complete a million successful transactions but to complete \*\*one\*\* successful transaction - and then \*\*repeat\*\* it a million times.

\*\*That\*\* is process management."

\*BPM for Dummies\*

"Simplicity is the \*\*ultimate\*\* sophistication."

\*Leonardo Da Vinci\*

"design \*\*simple\*\* systems that do \*\*complex\*\* things."

\*Roger Sessions, Simple Architectures for Complex Enterprises\*

"Simple \*\*can\*\* be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your \*\*thinking clean\*\* to make it \*\*simple\*\*. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, \*\*you\*\* can \*\*move\*\* mountains."

\*steve jobs\*

A business model describes the \*\*rationale\*\* of \*\*how\*\* an organization \*\*creates, captures and delivers value\*\*

\*(Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010)\*
